### What I learned

In this challenge i learned how to properly use live server package, some css and proper html structure.

### Continued development

I would love to keep learning about flex box to get a proper knowledge on managing content space and position, after that i plan on using tailwind, this is, after i get a proper foundation on vanilla CSS.
